Project Proposal

Client
A tech start up wants to build an app that identifies specific spots in NYC that
are more prone to parking violations so that people can avoid those areas or
look for alternative parking arrangements.

Need
Inadequate free parking spots in the city which gets worse during weekends and
when major events happen in the area.

Data Description
Data is primarily obtained from the NYC Parking violations data set

Solution Path
Access the data to identify what are some specific characteristics of areas, day,
vehicles that are more prone to be involved in a parking violation.

Tools Used
I will be using Excel to perform basic cleaning and merging other datasets, Tableau
to visualize the findings.

MVP will be a better scoping of the project and identifying one or more key
patterns through visualization.
